Following this link: http://thejackalofjavascript.com/getting-started-mqtt/ 
and this: https://github.com/mcollina/mosca/wiki/Mosca-basic-usage 

Better tutorial about Mosca here: https://github.com/mcollina/mosca/wiki/Mosca-basic-usage 
Next step is to try the same broker with clients written in python which can be used directly on a pi or an arduino, or any embedded linux system.
