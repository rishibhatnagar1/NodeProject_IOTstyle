#Writing a server using Exprestify

All the details on how to get started with it are mentioned here: https://github.com/ajithnn/exprestify

This module has been written by Ajith N N and he has made all our lives easy by writing this. To get started with it, do the following:
Go to the project folder - npm install exprestify --save 


You use -- save so that it writes the dependency in package.json file by itself. 

Once this is done, you can use the code in index.js to write a very simple server , i will be using this is multiple projects. I have also pushed the server on Heroku. Yes I love these people!
