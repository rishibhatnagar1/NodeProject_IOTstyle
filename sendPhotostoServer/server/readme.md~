#Send pictures to a server using an IOT board display them on a webpage/phone app

This project is aimed at making the link between the IOT board and the cloud and fetching images from the cloud on a phone app or
a webpage.

The project has a python code, a server code and webpage code for now. I will be adding more details soon.
The code has been commented in case of any doubts, I will be writing a tutorial and a troubleshooting guide too.
